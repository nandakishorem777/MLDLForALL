# Simple Linear Regression

The goal of this project was to build a linear regression model from the ground up using Scikit Learn

The data used here is obtained from Public source. 

Implementation of the code is described in this video on my YouTube Channel, take a look https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbA2bbB_ii0&ab_channel=MLDLforAll
