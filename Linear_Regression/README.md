# Simple Linear Regression

The goal of this project was to build a linear regression model from the ground up using Scikit Learn

The data used here is obtained from Public source. 

Repository details:
 linear-regression-demo.ipynb is implementing linear regression using sklearn's LinearRegression() module
 Linear_Regression_Using_Sklearn_and_TF_Keras_ANN.ipynb is implementing linear regression using ANN as well. A comparison is drawn between both. 
You can try this using more data and see if ANN was able to outperform general Linear Regression for different tasks. 

Implementation of the code is described in this video on my YouTube Channel, take a look https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbA2bbB_ii0&ab_channel=MLDLforAll

Basic Theory behind Linear Regression goes in here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocNNVjTnP24&t=1075s&ab_channel=MLDLforAll
